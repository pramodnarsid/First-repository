            <p>The biggest relief in Pichimayum Jiban Devi's life came as a Rang De Loan. Yes, she says that the loan has been a huge relief from money lenders and the high rate of interests that they charge. Initially, to run her vegetable business, she used to avail small loans from money lenders and for repaying the same she would have to pay back a larger part of her earned profits; leaving her with nothing for herself. She then availed a loan of Rs. 8,000 from Rang De to expand her 10 year old business. She invested her first loan from Rang De to purchase vegetables from the Imphala wholesale market. Her profits have increased since then. She now earns a profit of Rs. 300-400 (approximately) a day. The easy to pay monthly instalments and the convenient interest rate has also helped her save up money. She proudly says that she is now able enough to provide her daughter with quality education ensuring that she fulfills her dream of becoming a doctor.</p>

            <p>The biggest relief in Pichimayum Jiban Devi's life came as a Rang De Loan. Yes, she says that the loan has been a huge relief from money lenders and the high rate of interests that they charge. Initially, to run her vegetable business, she used to avail small loans from money lenders and for repaying the same she would have to pay back a larger part of her earned profits; leaving her with nothing for herself. She then availed a loan of Rs. 8,000 from Rang De to expand her 10 year old business. She invested her first loan from Rang De to purchase vegetables from the Imphala wholesale market. Her profits have increased since then. She now earns a profit of Rs. 300-400 (approximately) a day. The easy to pay monthly instalments and the convenient interest rate has also helped her save up money. She proudly says that she is now able enough to provide her daughter with quality education ensuring that she fulfills her dream of becoming a doctor.</p>
